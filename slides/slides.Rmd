Everyone should know rmarkdown among R users. Its principle has not changed since a long time 
(md + R = Rmd -> output format) quite easy to start (write text, add code chunk, compile) but it can be harder to learn new skill to be more efficient and get full power. 

That is where known recipes can help master more advanced skills. R Markdown Cookbook was thought as a non linear documentation

We often see these rmarkdown little wizard mixing Text & Code to produce document. Aim is to look deeper into this today. This is not so magic.

.subtitle[About `fig.alt` chunk option]

---

Can be used with an external image

````markdown
```{r species-img, fig.alt = "Illustration of pinguins species : Chinstrap, Gentoo and Ad√©lia", out.width='60%', fig.align = 'center', echo = FALSE}`r ''`
knitr::include_graphics("https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/
figures/lter_penguins.png")
```
````
---

Or with R graphics

````markdown
```{r, include = FALSE}`r ''`
island_repart_alt <- "Horizontal bar chart, faceted by Species showing the number of penguins living on each island, Torgersen, Dream and Biscoe. Adelie lives on the three, whereas Gentoo on Biscoe and Chinstrap on Dream."
```

*```{r island-repart, fig.alt= island_repart_alt}`r ''`
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = island, fill = species)) +
  geom_bar(alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4"),
                    guide = FALSE) +

---

````markdown
```{css, echo = FALSE}`r ''`
/* header in blue */
h1, h2, h3 {
  color: #0A7FB2
}
```
````

Applied directly in the Rmd document without an external css file. 

???

Useful with few CSS like with examples or prototyping for instance.
echo = false is important if you don't want to show CSS source chunk in output


---

Using external file : 

````yaml
output:
  html_document:
    css: mystyle.css
````

Better suited to share style across documents.

.subtitle[Using Custom Blocks]

---

This is powered by [Pandoc's Fenced Divs](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#divs-and-spans) syntax:

```{cat, opts.label ='cat_md'}
::: {.highlight-box style="text-align: center;font-size: 1.5em;"}
The **`r heaviest_specie`** specie is heavier than other ! 
:::
```

---

```{r demo-box, echo = FALSE, results='asis', rm_temp = TRUE}
o <- tempfile()
rmarkdown::pandoc_convert(temp_file, to = "html", output = I(o))
content <- xfun::read_utf8(o)
unlink(o)
```

This will be rendered in HTML

```{cat, engine.opts = list(lang = "html"), code = content}
```

> I want to .color1[**add a border**] to create a box and .color1[**apply my blue color**].

Can I use variable for color and limit duplication ?

.subtitle[Using SASS]

.center[![:scale 20%, SASS Language logo](https://sass-lang.com/assets/img/logos/logo-b6e1ef6e.svg)]

Sass (https://sass-lang.com) is a CSS extension language that allows you to create CSS rules in much more flexible ways than you would do with plain CSS.

???

It allows for variables, tweaking functions (called _mixins_), operations (like `/`), better CSS rule organisation (nesting, extensions, ...) and more.

  border-style: solid;
  padding: 0.5em;

div.highlight-box strong {

.panel[.panel-name[scss]
````markdown

*$color1: #0A7FB2; /* using a variable */

*h1, h2, h3 {color: $color1;}

div { /* using nested organization */
  &.highlight-box { 
*   border-color: $color1;
    border-style: solid;
    padding: 0.5em;

    strong {
*     color: $color1;
    }
  }
}
```
````

]
.panel[.panel-name[sass]

````markdown
```{sass, echo = FALSE}`r ''`
$color1: #0A7FB2

h1, h2, h3
  color: $color1

div
  &.highlight-box
    border-color: $color1
    border-style: solid
    padding: 0.5em
  
    strong
      color: $color1
```
````

]
]

???

_sass_ syntax is shorter (no `;` and `{ }`) but more different from _css_ than _scss_, so less easy to get started.

In this example and the previous _scss_ one, we are using special _SASS_ features like [Nesting](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules/declarations#nesting) and [Parent Selector](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules/parent-selector).

This allows organization of CSS rules for easier reading and modifications.
